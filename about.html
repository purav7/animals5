            <h2>About "The Lost Ones"</h2>
            <p>The Lost Ones is a multimedia project that focuses on the extinction of animal species caused by human actions. The project aims to raise awareness about the devastating effects of habitat destruction, poaching, pollution, and climate change on our planet's wildlife. By remembering the species we have lost, we hope to inspire change and prevent further extinctions in the future.</p>
            <p>Through compelling storytelling, educational resources, and conservation initiatives, The Lost Ones seeks to be a voice for the extinct species that once roamed the Earth. Our ultimate goal is to foster a deeper appreciation for biodiversity and the fragile ecosystems that support all life on our planet.</p>

        <!-- Mission Statement -->
        <section id="mission-statement">
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At The Lost Ones, we believe that by understanding the causes and consequences of extinction, we can take action to prevent it. Our mission is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Raise awareness about the extinction crisis affecting wildlife around the world.</li>
                <li>Educate the public on the causes of species extinction, particularly human-driven factors.</li>
                <li>Honor the memory of lost species and ensure their stories are never forgotten.</li>
                <li>Promote sustainable practices and policies to protect endangered species and their habitats.</li>
                <li>Inspire individuals and organizations to take action in their own communities to protect biodiversity.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Causes of Extinction -->
        <section id="extinction-causes">
            <h2>Causes of Extinction</h2>
            <p>There are several key human activities that have led to the extinction of numerous species throughout history. These activities have disrupted ecosystems, reduced biodiversity, and pushed many species to the brink of disappearance. The main causes of extinction include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Habitat Destruction:</strong> The conversion of forests, wetlands, and grasslands into urban and agricultural spaces has destroyed natural habitats, making it difficult for species to survive.</li>
                <li><strong>Poaching and Illegal Wildlife Trade:</strong> Overhunting, poaching, and the illegal trade of animals for their fur, horns, or bones have led to the decline of many species, including rhinos, elephants, and tigers.</li>
                <li><strong>Pollution:</strong> Chemical pollution, plastic waste, and oil spills have harmed both terrestrial and marine species, causing widespread deaths and affecting reproductive systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Global warming, rising sea levels, and altered weather patterns are shifting ecosystems, making it harder for species to adapt and thrive in their natural habitats.</li>
                <li><strong>Invasive Species:</strong> Non-native species introduced to new areas can outcompete, prey upon, or bring diseases to native species, resulting in local extinctions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We believe that by addressing these issues and promoting responsible stewardship of the Earth, we can help prevent further extinctions and preserve the diversity of life on our planet.</p>
